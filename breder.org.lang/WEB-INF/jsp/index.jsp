The index of this page is : 
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>target</b></li>
    <p>
        The Breder Language is a high level language with strong typing and static scope.
        This best thinks of this language is to build a project that you need to use a high level language and a low level language.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, the target is to get a project with many data struct, Object Orientation, Gargage Collection and has many processing in the C Language Environment.
        With this, every big processing will run in the C Language Environment and every struct processing will run in the Breder Language.
    </p>
    <p>
        This language was builded for PC and Mobile. With this, the Breder Language need be very fast with processing and many code of API is implemented in the C Language.
        For all this work with performance, the Breder Virtual Machine need be very fast with the change of Breder Language to C Language and the chance of C Language for Breder Language.
    </p>
