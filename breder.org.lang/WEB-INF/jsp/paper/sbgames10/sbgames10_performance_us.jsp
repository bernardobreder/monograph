In this session, we will comment discuss and analyze the performance obtained using our language and framework. 
On the assumptions that were necessary for an Interpreted Language can process so tolerable by applications. 
As mentioned previously, in order to.

Several optimizations are were designed to meet the processing overhead that leads to the Breder Virtual Machine, such as the development of native methods. 
For example, if the framework uses native methods, will decrease so much that overhead.
</p>

<p>
Besides the optimization of native methods that has been widely used both in the framework, as in the standard library available in Language, Breder Virtual Machine was built with the purpose of meeting and seeking the execution of native methods. 
Thus, when there is a need to perform native operation, the Breder Virtual Machine will not generate any kind of processing overhead.

<p>
The Garbage Collector is designed with goal of releasing the unused objects from memory. 
Beyond this, the Garbage Collector finds the projects of great real-time processing. 
In the case of applications for iPhone, as the Garbage Collector is acting in the release objects from memory the image can not be frozen. 
In the demo, did not find any kind of freezing as a function of performance of the Garbage Collector.

The example set by the demo, shows the degree of stress graph that was generated to test if the programming environment does not fit in projects with many images. 
In this demo, we printed more than 700 components at the same time, in which each exchange screen, will always be updated on her condition and repainted. 
Even with the polluted environment of images, the result was very satisfactory, since that was not found any sign of slowdown in the application.
</p>

<p>
The same is true when some event has touch screen. 
The framework will cover all the components looking for the children who suffer the event. 
This search has become very fast, as it was performed several optimizations on the query.
