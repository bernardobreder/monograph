Programming for Objective-C Language does not provide all the resources necessary for a good development. 
It because it has a difficulty syntax from other Languages and it is very low level programming. 
For the developers, they will try to find a new development environment for programming simplely, investing you time in the logic of the aplication and not with thinks that the Language need to work. 
Would be good if the development environment uses high level popular Programming Language.
</p>

<p>
With this in mind, it should be established the usage of a more popular Programming Language with better features, such as Java, C+ +, Python, among others. 
But, this Language need be a high level, because the programmer do not want to worry with litter thinks, only with the logic of the aplication.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, Objective-C Language has no abstract capabilities enough to meet an easy implementation of complex features, typically required in games. 
This is because the Language does not provide tools, abstract features and libraries that facilitate the implementation, making it necessary to develop such resources.
</p>

<p>
For example, the Objective-C Language does not provide a complete memory management transparently [STEPHEN G. KOCHAN]. 
In this way, the developer can use unauthorized memory in a  wrong way, causing lower permanence manipulation of objects in memory or even the fall of the application execution. 
When this occurs, it is unproductive the detection and clearance of the problem.
</p>

<p>
To resolve the lack of transparency in the management of memory, it Is necessary to create mechanisms to release the objects automatically. 
That would be the mechanism to recognize the objects that are no longer being used, releasing them from the memory. 
To implement such a mechanism, it is necessary to implement the concept of Garbage Collection in a transparent manner.
</p>

<p>
Another thinks that Objective-C Language is not so good for programming to iPhone, is because do not have a safe executing. 
It because, the application is compiled for the machine and if a error happen, the process will be killed. 
It will be good is the executing of the application is manager by a Virtual Machine. 
With this way, a error will not kill the process, doing the execute more safe.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, the best way to capture erros is in the compiler timer. 
If you have a error in runtime, this is a unproductive development to right this error. 
At compiler timer, the error is better and easier to resolver be, because the errors are not provided in a specific context. 
</p>

<p>
If the error is in runtime, the developer need to execute the application for understand what happening. 
With this, the developer need to know what context that is happening and why. 
Thus, a good structure of language to retrieval errors at compile time, can generate greater productivity.

<p>
Apple offers several complex framework and low level development specifically for the iPhone platform. 
However, its misuse can result in failures that are difficult to deal. 
To resolve the complexity of the standards framework, the developr must create an abstraction in order to reduce failures that may occur. 
This will create operations that do not generate side effects if they are called improperly.
