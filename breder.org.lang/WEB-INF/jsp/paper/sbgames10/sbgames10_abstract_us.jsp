This paper, propose a new framework definition for programming to iPhone with simplicity and productively. 
With this way, the developer can create a application, thinking only the logic of the game, forgeting the difficulties of framework and native Language for programming to iPhone.
</p>

<p>
This framework has simple and objective features to ensure the practicality of programming for iPhone. 
For this, we implemented a specification based on typical game framework architectures, which meets these requirements by using a Programming Language. 
</p>

<p>
The Objetive-C Language used for programming to iPhone is a low level Language[STEPHEN G. KOCHAN]. 
With this, the developer need to implement and manager many thinks in the environment that should not worry. 
Because of that, it will be good if the developer can use a high level Language in which will only worry about the logic of the application.

<p>
In this paper, will be used the Breder Programming Language for implement this framework. 
It because, the Breder Language is a high level Language that has many features to ensure the further structuring of code and productivity [blind for revision]. 
Moreover, this Language was developed to assist projects that require high efficiency in native method call deployed in some external library, that will be use for comunication with iPhone framework [blind for revision].
