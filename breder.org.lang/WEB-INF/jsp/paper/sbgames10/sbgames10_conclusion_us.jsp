In this paper we proposed a new language architecture, a game framework based on it and a simple application to validate.  
This applications where developed for an iPhone platform and showed the possibility to create games without the usage of Objective C. 
Our work also validate the possibility to develop games for iPhone without the need of knowing its specific architecture, thanks to the Breder Virtual Machine.

<p>
In addition, several optimizations were made with the framework, in order to improve its funtionality. 
The frame rate obtained for a high number of game objects validates the framework for a high level game development.

<p>
The suggested development environment of an application for the iPhone, using the Breder Language, would be the Eclipse and XCode. 
Eclipse became simpler to use the framework since the Compiler acts all the time. 
So, when change is made in the source code, automatically, the Compiler will recompile the source code. 
This feature makes the usage of Breder language very simple to make any modification in the source code, making very productive development.
